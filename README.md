Preprocessor for C Language

This project implements a preprocessor for the C programming language, extending the capabilities of the standard C preprocessor by providing additional features and simplifying code organization. The preprocessor processes C source code files, handles directives, and generates an intermediate file that can be further compiled by a standard C compiler.

Features

Macro Support: Define and use macros to create reusable code snippets and improve code readability.
Include Directives: Include external files in the C code for better code organization.
Conditional Compilation: Use conditional directives to selectively include or exclude portions of the code during compilation.
Pragma Directives: Implement pragma directives for compiler-specific instructions.
Prerequisites

A compatible C compiler (e.g., GCC).
